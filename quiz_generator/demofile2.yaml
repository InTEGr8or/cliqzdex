      \ to monitor your applications, respond to system-wide performance changes,\
      \ optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health.\
      \ CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics,\
      \ and events, providing you with a unified view of AWS resources, applications,\
      \ and services that run on AWS and on-premises servers. You can use CloudWatch\
      \ to detect anomalous behavior in your environments, set alarms, visualize logs\
      \ and metrics side by side, take automated actions, troubleshoot issues, and\
      \ discover insights to keep your applications  \n running smoothly.  \n \n\n\
      \         Amazon CloudWatch: Complete visibility of your cloud resources and\
      \ applications (2:02)             Benefits\n---------\n\n   ###  Observability\
      \ on a single platform across applications and infrastructure\n\n  Modern applications\
      \ such as those running on microservices architectures generate large volumes\
      \ of data in the form of metrics, logs, and events. Amazon CloudWatch enables\
      \ you to collect, access, and correlate this data on a single platform from\
      \ across all your AWS resources, applications, and services that run on AWS\
      \ and on-premises servers, helping you break down data silos so you can easily\
      \ gain system-wide visibility and quickly resolve issues.  \n \n\n    ###  Easiest\
      \ way to collect metrics in AWS and on-premises\n\n  Monitoring your AWS resources\
      \ and applications is easy with CloudWatch. It natively integrates with more\
      \ than 70 AWS services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon S3, Amazon\
      \ ECS, Amazon EKS, and AWS Lambda, and automatically publishes detailed 1-minute\
      \ metrics and custom metrics with up to 1-second granularity so you can dive\
      \ deep into your logs for additional context. You can also use CloudWatch in\
      \ hybrid cloud architectures by using the CloudWatch Agent or API to monitor\
      \ your on-premises resources.  \n \n\n    ###  Improve operational performance\
      \ and resource optimization\n\n  Amazon CloudWatch enables you to set alarms\
      \ and automate actions based on either predefined thresholds, or on machine\
      \ learning algorithms that identify anomalous behavior in your metrics. For\
      \ example, it can start Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling automatically, or stop an instance\
      \ to reduce billing overages. You can also use CloudWatch Events for serverless\
      \ to trigger workflows with services like AWS Lambda, Amazon SNS, and AWS CloudFormation.\
      \  \n \n\n      ###  Get operational visibility and insight\n\n  To optimize\
      \ performance and resource utilization, you need a unified operational view,\
      \ real-time granular data, and historical reference. CloudWatch provides automatic\
      \ dashboards, data with 1-second granularity, and up to 15 months of metrics\
      \ storage and retention. You can also perform metric math on your data to derive\
      \ operational and utilization insights; for example, you can aggregate usage\
      \ across an entire fleet of EC2 instances.  \n \n\n    ###  Derive actionable\
      \ insights from logs\n\n  CloudWatch enables you to explore, analyze, and visualize\
      \ your logs so you can troubleshoot operational problems with ease. With CloudWatch\
      \ Logs Insights, you only pay for the queries you run. It scales with your log\
      \ volume and query complexity giving you answers in seconds. In addition, you\
      \ can publish log-based metrics, create alarms, and correlate logs and metrics\
      \ together in CloudWatch Dashboards for complete operational visibility.  \n\
      \ \n\n                How it works\n-------------\n\n  CloudWatch collects monitoring\
      \ and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events, and visualizes\
      \ it using automated dashboards so you can get a unified view of your AWS resources,\
      \ applications, and services that run in AWS and on-premises. You can correlate\
      \ your metrics and logs to better understand the health and performance of your\
      \ resources. You can also create alarms based on metric value thresholds you\
      \ specify, or that can watch for anomalous metric behavior based on machine\
      \ learning algorithms. To take action quickly, you can set up automated actions\
      \ to notify you if an alarm is triggered and automatically start auto scaling,\
      \ for example, to help reduce mean-time-to-resolution. You can also dive deep\
      \ and analyze your metrics, logs, and traces, to better understand how to improve\
      \ application performance.  \n \n\n    ![How Amazon CloudWatch works](//d1.awsstatic.com/product-marketing/cloudwatch/product-page-diagram_Cloudwatch_v4.55c15d1cc086395cbd5ad279a2f1fc37e8452e77.png\
      \ \"How Amazon CloudWatch works\")          Use cases\n----------\n\n     ###\
      \  Infrastructure monitoring and troubleshooting\n\n  Monitor key metrics and\
      \ logs, visualize your application and infrastructure stack, create alarms,\
      \ and correlate metrics and logs to understand and resolve root cause of performance\
      \ issues in your AWS resources. This includes monitoring your container ecosystem\
      \ across Amazon ECS, AWS Fargate, Amazon EKS, and Kubernetes.  \n \n\n     \
      \ ###  Mean-time-to-resolution improvement\n\n  CloudWatch helps you correlate,\
      \ visualize, and analyze metrics and logs, so you can act quickly to resolve\
      \ issues, and combine them with trace data from AWS X-Ray for end-to-end observability.\
      \ You can also analyze user requests to help speed up troubleshooting and debugging,\
      \ and reduce overall mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR).  \n \n\n      ###  Proactive\
      \ resource optimization\n\n  CloudWatch alarms watch your metric values against\
      \ thresholds that either you specify, or that CloudWatch creates for you using\
      \ machine learning models to detect anomalous behavior. If an alarm is triggered,\
      \ CloudWatch can take action automatically to enable Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling\
      \ or stop an instance, for example, so you can automate capacity and resource\
      \ planning.\n\n      ###  Application monitoring\n\n  Monitor your applications\
      \ that run on AWS (on Amazon EC2, containers, and serverless) or on-premises.\
      \ CloudWatch collects data at every layer of the performance stack, including\
      \ metrics and logs on automatic dashboards.  \n \n\n      ###  Log analytics\n\
      \n  Explore, analyze, and visualize your logs to address operational issues\
      \ and improve applications performance. You can perform queries to help you\
      \ quickly and effectively respond to operational issues. If an issue occurs,\
      \ you can start querying immediately using a purpose-built query language to\
      \ rapidly identify potential causes.\n\n             \n>  \u201CWe use a microservices-based\
      \ architecture. Amazon CloudWatch was an instant solution as it required no\
      \ infrastructure setup or maintenance. CloudWatch has no issues handling our\

- Comprehend:
    description: "   Amazon Comprehend is a natural language processing (NLP) service\
      \ that uses machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. No\
      \ machine learning experience required.\n\n There is a treasure trove of potential\
      \ sitting in your unstructured data. Customer emails, support tickets, product\
      \ reviews, social media, even advertising copy represents insights into customer\
      \ sentiment that can be put to work for your business. The question is how to\
      \ get at it? As it turns out, Machine learning is particularly good at accurately\
      \ identifying specific items of interest inside vast swathes of text (such as\
      \ finding company names in analyst reports), and can learn the sentiment hidden\
      \ inside language (identifying negative reviews, or positive customer interactions\
      \ with customer service agents), at almost limitless scale.\n\n Amazon Comprehend\
      \ uses machine learning to help you uncover the insights and relationships in\
      \ your unstructured data. The service identifies the language of the text; extracts\
      \ key phrases, places, people, brands, or events; understands how positive or\
      \ negative the text is; analyzes text using tokenization and parts of speech;\
      \ and automatically organizes a collection of text files by topic. You can also\
      \ use AutoML capabilities in Amazon Comprehend to build a custom set of entities\
      \ or text classification models that are tailored uniquely to your organization\u2019\
      s needs.\n\n For extracting complex medical information from unstructured text,\
      \ you can use [**Amazon Comprehend Medical**](http://www.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/medical).\
      \ The service can identify medical information, such as medical conditions,\
      \ medications, dosages, strengths, and frequencies from a variety of sources\
      \ like doctor\u2019s notes, clinical trial reports, and patient health records.\
      \ Amazon Comprehend Medical also identifies the relationship among the extracted\
      \ medication and test, treatment and procedure information for easier analysis.\
      \ For example, the service identifies a particular dosage, strength, and frequency\
      \ related to a specific medication from unstructured clinical notes.\n\n Amazon\
      \ Comprehend is fully managed, so there are no servers to provision, and no\
      \ machine learning models to build, train, or deploy. You pay only for what\
      \ you use, and there are no minimum fees and no upfront commitments.\n\n   \

- Connect:
    description: "     Amazon Connect is an easy to use omnichannel cloud contact\
      \ center that helps companies provide superior customer service at a lower cost.\
      \ Over 10 years ago, Amazon\u2019s retail business needed a contact center that\
      \ would give our customers personal, dynamic, and natural experiences. We couldn\u2019\
      t find one that met our needs, so we built it. We've now made this available\
      \ for all businesses, and today thousands of companies ranging from 10 to tens\
      \ of thousands of agents use Amazon Connect to serve millions of customers daily.\n\
      \n Designed from the ground up to be omnichannel, Amazon Connect provides a\
      \ seamless experience across voice and chat for your customers and agents. This\
      \ includes one set of tools for skills-based routing, powerful real-time and\
      \ historical analytics, and easy-to-use intuitive management tools \u2013 all\
      \ with pay-as-you-go pricing, which means Amazon Connect simplifies contact\
      \ center operations, improves agent efficiency, and lowers costs. You can set\
      \ up a contact center in minutes that can scale to support millions of customers.\
      \  \n \n\n         What is Amazon Connect?             Benefits\n=========\n\
      \n   ###  Make changes in minutes not months\n\n  Amazon Connect is so simple\
      \ to set-up and use, you can increase your speed of innovation. With only a\
      \ few clicks, you can set up an omnichannel contact center and agents can begin\
      \ talking and messaging with customers. You can also reuse the same automated\
      \ interactions you already have to create chat flows. Making changes is easy\
      \ with an intuitive UI that allows you to create voice and chat contact flows,\
      \ without any coding, rather than custom development that can take months and\
      \ cost millions of dollars.  \n \n\n    ###  Save up to 80% over traditional\
      \ contact center solutions\n\n  Amazon Connect costs less than legacy contact\
      \ center systems. With Amazon Connect you pay only for the time you spend interacting\
      \ with customers, plus any associated telephony and messaging charges. With\
      \ Amazon Connect there are no minimum monthly fees, long-term commitments, upfront\
      \ license charges, and pricing is not based on peak capacity, agent seats, or\
      \ maintenance.  \n \n\n    ###  Easily scale to meet unpredictable demand\n\n\
      \  With Amazon Connect you can scale your contact center up or down to any size,\
      \ onboarding tens of thousands of agents in response to normal business cycles\
      \ or unplanned events. As part of the AWS cloud, you can support your customers\
      \ by accessing Amazon Connect from anywhere in the world in a secure, reliable,\
      \ and highly scalable way. Agents and managers just need a supported web browser\
      \ and an internet connection to engage with customers from anywhere.  \n \n\n\
      \              Capabilities\n=============\n\n   ###  Omnichannel customer service\n\
      \n  Amazon Connect provides a seamless omnichannel experience through a single\
      \ unified contact center for voice and chat. Contact center agents and managers\
      \ don\u2019t have to learn multiple tools, because Amazon Connect has the same\
      \ contact routing, queuing, analytics, and management tools in a single UI across\
      \ voice, web chat, and mobile chat. With Amazon Connect you can also use the\
      \ same automated interactions and chatbots across channels to increase operational\
      \ efficiency. This means your customers can interact with your agents based\
      \ on factors such as personal preferences and wait times, they can keep working\
      \ with the same agent across channels, and their interaction history is preserved,\
      \ so they don\u2019t have to repeat themselves, improving customer experience\
      \ and reducing resolution time.\n\n [Learn about Amazon Connect\u2019s high-quality\

      \ Connect\u2019s secure flexible chat \xBB](/connect/features/#Web_and_mobile_chat)\
      \  \n   \n \n\n    ###  Flexibility and agility\n\n  Amazon Connect is an open\
      \ platform that easily integrates with any system that your contact center relies\
      \ on, such as customer relationship management (CRM), workforce optimization\
      \ (WFO), or workforce management (WFM) systems. For example, you can use AWS\
      \ Lambda to access virtually any backend system to personalize automated experiences\
      \ and provide conversation history and real-time context to agents as customers\
      \ switch between voice and chat channels. There is no need for connectors or\
      \ professional services to build contact flow experiences that adapt to your\
      \ customer needs.  \n \n\n    ###  Out-of-the box intelligence\n\n  Amazon Connect\
      \ is AI-enabled by default, allowing agents to immediately use AWS AI services\
      \ with Amazon Connect to automate interactions and improve customer service.\
      \ Amazon Connect has natural text-to-speech built-in so you can create personalized\
      \ messages in real-time and with Amazon Lex, an Amazon service that builds conversational\
      \ interfaces into any application with speech-to-text and Natural Language Understanding\
      \ (NLU), you can use the same powerful technology that powers Alexa across voice\
      \ and chat, easing the handoff between agents with context. Amazon Connect also\
      \ leverages AI to transcribe calls and show caller sentiment in real-time, and\
      \ then mine your customer engagement data to surface insights and spot trends.\n\
      \n [Contact Lens for Amazon Connect](/connect/contact-lens/) is a set of machine\
      \ learning capabilities integrated into Amazon Connect that allows contact center\
      \ supervisors to better understand the sentiment, trends, and compliance risks\
      \ of customer conversations to effectively train agents, replicate successful\
      \ interactions, and identify crucial company and product feedback.  \n \n\n\

      \n ###  Description\n\n  Whether it\u2019s for the scalability and flexibility,\
      \ or to take advantage of automatic maintenance and upgrades, there are many\
      \ benefits to migrating your call center to the cloud. I will help you migrate\
      \ quickly and seamlessly from your on-premise call center to Amazon Connect.\n\
      \n The first step is to meet and review your current solution and identify the\
      \ goals you have for this migration. I am familiar with many on-premise solutions\
      \ and will provide guidance and recommendations on the best approach to the\
      \ migration. This will include budget guidance and estimates. After our initial\
      \ consultation I will deliver the migration plan containing the key product\
      \ and technical details of the Amazon Connect migration.  \n   \n The next step\
      \ is to setup and configure Amazon Connect with the appropriate contact flow\
      \ as determined from step one. I will setup Amazon Connect directly in your\
      \ AWS account, including all roles and permissions required for your team to\
      \ manage and administrate it moving forward. Once completed I will deliver an\
      \ installation report with the key technical details for your team to be able\
      \ to assume the management of the system.  \n   \n The last step is to train\
      \ a small set of your agents on how to use the new Amazon Connect system. If\
      \ you have a larger team you can either have your agent\u2019s share their learnings\
      \ or we can arrange further training sessions. I will walk them through the\
      \ common use cases and answer any questions they have. I will also provide documentation\
      \ for reference and for other agents to be easily onboarded.  \n   \n Finally\
      \ I will provide one month of additional email support for any setup-related\
      \ questions your team has. I have seven years of experience with AWS and I have\
      \ helped many customers successfully adopt AWS technologies. I look forward\
      \ to helping you with your success story.  \n \n\n  ###  Pricing\n\n  $2,000\

      \ and managing your Amazon Connect system\u2019s real-time metrics is crucial\
      \ to keeping customers satisfied. A wallboard is a dashboard showing real-time\
      \ metrics that can answer questions like \u201CHow productive are my agents\u201D\
      \ or \u201Cwhat is the current longest waiting call in a queue\u201D. I will\
      \ setup and build a wallboard for your business.\n\n In step one we will identify\
      \ the list of metrics required for your wallboard solution. If requested I can\
      \ provide feedback and guidance based on my experience building similar wallboards.\
      \ We will review the security, roles and permissions required. When complete\
      \ I will provide a write up containing the high-level design of the wallboard\
      \ design specified.\n\n In step two I will implement the wallboard using a python\
      \ dynamic web application that connects directly to your Amazon Connect system.\
      \ I will configure it and install it directly in your AWS account. I will email\
      \ a short writeup of the technical details of the solution when complete.\n\n\
      \ In step three we will review the solution to ensure everything meets your\
      \ expectations. I will answer any questions you have. I will also provide two\
      \ additional weeks of support after the job is complete.  \n   \n **Key deliverables:**\n\

      \n ###  Description\n\n  By using an Amazon Lex chatbot in your Amazon Connect\
      \ call center, you can provide your customers the ability to perform tasks such\
      \ as changing a password, requesting a balance on an account, or scheduling\
      \ an appointment, without needing to speak to an agent. These chatbots use automatic\
      \ speech recognition and natural language understanding to recognize the intent\
      \ of the caller. I will design, build, and implement chatbot solutions for your\
      \ Amazon Connect workflow.\n\n The first step is to review your existing Amazon\
      \ Connect workflow and establish the goals for your new chatbot. I will provide\
      \ feedback and recommendations on which approaches work best and provide you\
      \ tradeoffs on your different ideas. At the end of this step I will provide\
      \ an implementation plan that includes the delivery timeline.\n\n In step two\
      \ I will design and build the Amazon Lex chatbot and natural language model\
      \ required for your solution. I will configure and install it directly into\
      \ your Amazon Connect installation. I will also make any updates necessary to\
      \ ensure it is successful and meets your requirements established in step one.\n\
      \n In step three I will provide a writeup on how the new chatbot works and the\
      \ technical documentation for anyone who needs to make future changes to it.\
      \ We will review the solution and the technical documentation and I will provide\
      \ answers to any questions you have.\n\n Key deliverables:\n\n \n 2. Initial\
      \ requirement document and delivery timeline\n 4. Custom written chatbot configured\
      \ and installed directly into your Amazon Connect solution\n 6. A technical\
      \ summary document explaining how the solution works and where the key components\
      \ are, including access to the source code and configuration data\n 8. I will\
      \ also provide answers to any questions you have for one week post-delivery\
      \ of step three.\n \n I hold three AWS Certifications including the Alexa Skill\
      \ Builder Specialty Certification. I have extensive experience in voice-first\
      \ application design and development, as well as integrating AWS services into\
      \ these solutions. I am confident I can help your business by providing delightful\
      \ voice or text automated solutions.  \n \n\n  ###  Pricing\n\n  $5,000  \n\

      \ an initial consultation to understand your business, desired outcomes, and\
      \ budget. I can provide guidance and advice on the best options for your needs.\
      \ I will collect critical information such as the inbound and outbound phone\

      \ with you the project plan that includes the critical components to the project\
      \ and a timeline for delivery.\n\n I will then implement the solution as specified.\
      \ This includes configuring and setting up agent configuration, route group\

      \  Ad Tech\n\n  Companies in the advertising technology (ad tech) vertical use\
      \ DynamoDB as a key-value store for storing various kinds of marketing data,\
      \ such as user profiles, user events, clicks, and visited links. Applicable\
      \ use cases include real-time bidding (RTB), ad targeting, and attribution.\
      \ These use cases require a high request rate (millions of requests per second),\
      \ low predictable latency, and reliability. Companies use caching through DynamoDB\
      \ Accelerator (DAX) when they have high read volumes or need submillisecond\
      \ read latency. Increasingly, ad tech companies need to deploy their RTB and\
      \ ad targeting platforms in more than one geographical AWS Region, which requires\
      \ data replication between Regions.\n\n    ###  Gaming\n\n  Companies in the\
      \ gaming vertical use DynamoDB in all capabilities of game platforms, including\
      \ game state, player data, session history, and leaderboards. The main benefits\
      \ that these companies get from DynamoDB are its ability to scale reliably to\
      \ millions of concurrent users and requests while ensuring consistently low\
      \ latency measured in single-digit milliseconds. In addition, as a fully managed\
      \ service, DynamoDB has no operational overhead, so game developers can focus\
      \ on developing their games instead of managing databases. Also, as game developers\
      \ are increasingly looking to expand from a single AWS Region to multiple AWS\
      \ Regions, they can rely on DynamoDB global tables for multiple-Region, active-active\
      \ replication of data.\n\n         **Common use cases:**\n\n \n * User profile\
      \ stores in RTB and ad targeting\n * User events, clickstreams, and impressions\

      \  Retail\n\n  Many companies in the retail space use common DynamoDB design\
      \ patterns to deliver consistently low latency for mission-critical use cases.\
      \ Being free from scaling concerns and operational burden is a key competitive\
      \ advantage and an enabler for high-velocity, extreme-scaled events such as\
      \ Amazon Prime Day, whose magnitudes are difficult to forecast. Scaling up and\
      \ down allows these customers to pay only for the capacity they need and keeps\
      \ precious technical resources focused on innovations rather than operations.\n\
      \n  \n\n    ###  Banking and Finance\n\n  As companies in banking and finance\
      \ build more cloud-native applications, they seek to use fully managed services\
      \ to increase agility, reduce time to market, and minimize operational overhead.\
      \ At the same time, they have to ensure the security, reliability, and high\
      \ availability of their applications. As these companies expand their existing\
      \ services that are backed by legacy mainframe systems, they find that legacy\
      \ systems are unable to meet the scalability demands of their growing user base,\
      \ new platforms such as mobile applications, and the resulting increases in\
      \ traffic. To solve this problem, they replicate data from their mainframes\
      \ to the cloud to offload the traffic.\n\n         **Common use cases:**\n\n\

      \  Media and entertainment\n\n  Media and entertainment companies use DynamoDB\
      \ when they require an extreme scale of throughput and concurrency, low latency,\
      \ and reliability. DynamoDB scales elastically to handle the load and maintains\
      \ low latency that is critical for real-time scenarios, such as video streaming\
      \ and interactive content. In such scenarios, the number of concurrent users\
      \ can reach millions, and no database handles that kind of concurrency as well\
      \ as DynamoDB. Despite such high concurrency, the latency remains low, affording\
      \ individual users optimal user experience, whether it involves retrieving their\
      \ media, or participating in an interactive, real-time event. These companies\
      \ use DynamoDB to address their scalability challenges and to keep their focus\
      \ on feature development and not on database management.\n\n    ###  Software\
      \ and internet\n\n  One key commonality among software companies and many other\
      \ DynamoDB customers is internet scale. These companies\u2019 use cases require\
      \ the ability to accommodate extreme concurrency, request rates, and spikes\
      \ in traffic. This concurrency is measured in millions of users and connections,\
      \ and request rates can easily reach millions per second. DynamoDB has a proven\
      \ record of being able to handle internet-scale use cases and their requirements\
      \ while maintaining consistent, single-digit millisecond latency. With global\
      \ tables, DynamoDB customers can easily expand their applications to multiple\
      \ AWS Regions for global reach and business continuity.\n\n         **Common\

      \ Inference supports TensorFlow, Apache MXNet, PyTorch and ONNX models.\n\n\
      \ Inference is the process of making predictions using a trained model. In deep\
      \ learning applications, inference accounts for up to 90% of total operational\
      \ costs for two reasons. Firstly, standalone GPU instances are typically designed\
      \ for model training - not for inference. While training jobs batch process\
      \ hundreds of data samples in parallel, inference jobs usually process a single\
      \ input in real time, and thus consume a small amount of GPU compute. This makes\
      \ standalone GPU inference cost-inefficient. On the other hand, standalone CPU\
      \ instances are not specialized for matrix operations, and thus are often too\
      \ slow for deep learning inference. Secondly, different models have different\
      \ CPU, GPU, and memory requirements. Optimizing for one resource can lead to\

    description: "    Amazon Forecast is a fully managed service that uses machine\
      \ learning to deliver highly accurate forecasts.  \n \n\n Companies today use\
      \ everything from simple spreadsheets to complex financial planning software\
      \ to attempt to accurately forecast future business outcomes such as product\
      \ demand, resource needs, or financial performance. These tools build forecasts\
      \ by looking at a historical series of data, which is called time series data.\
      \ For example, such tools may try to predict the future sales of a raincoat\
      \ by looking only at its previous sales data with the underlying assumption\
      \ that the future is determined by the past. This approach can struggle to produce\
      \ accurate forecasts for large sets of data that have irregular trends. Also,\
      \ it fails to easily combine data series that change over time (such as price,\
      \ discounts, web traffic, and number of employees) with relevant independent\
      \ variables like product features and store locations.  \n \n\n Based on the\
      \ same technology used at Amazon.com, Amazon Forecast uses machine learning\
      \ to combine time series data with additional variables to build forecasts.\
      \ Amazon Forecast requires no machine learning experience to get started. You\
      \ only need to provide historical data, plus any additional data that you believe\
      \ may impact your forecasts. For example, the demand for a particular color\
      \ of a shirt may change with the seasons and store location. This complex relationship\
      \ is hard to determine on its own, but machine learning is ideally suited to\
      \ recognize it. Once you provide your data, Amazon Forecast will automatically\
      \ examine it, identify what is meaningful, and produce a forecasting model capable\
      \ of making predictions that are up to 50% more accurate than looking at time\
      \ series data alone.  \n \n\n Amazon Forecast is a fully managed service, so\
      \ there are no servers to provision, and no machine learning models to build,\
      \ train, or deploy. You pay only for what you use, and there are no minimum\
      \ fees and no upfront commitments.  \n \n\n     "

      \ you build with AWS Lambda? Learn more about the use cases below:  \n \n\n\
      \    ###  Data processing\n\n  You can use AWS Lambda to execute code in response\
      \ to triggers such as changes in data, shifts in system state, or actions by\
      \ users. Lambda can be directly triggered by AWS services such as S3, DynamoDB,\
      \ Kinesis, SNS, and CloudWatch, can connect to existing EFS file systems, or\
      \ it can be orchestrated into workflows by [AWS Step Functions](/step-functions/).\
      \ This allows you to build a variety of real-time [serverless](/serverless/)\
      \ data processing systems.  \n \n\n  ####  Real-time file processing\n\n  You\
      \ can use Amazon S3 to trigger AWS Lambda to process data immediately after\
      \ an upload. You can also connect to an existing Amazon EFS file system directly,\
      \ which enables massively parallel shared access for large scale file processing.\
      \ For example, you can use Lambda to thumbnail images, transcode videos, index\
      \ files, process logs, validate content, and aggregate and filter data in real-time.\

      \ like Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS, you can invest in reserved capacity. With\
      \ Reserved Instances, you can save up to 75% over equivalent on-demand capacity.\
      \ Reserved Instances are available in 3 options \u2013 All up-front (AURI),\
      \ partial up-front (PURI) or no upfront payments (NURI).\n\n When you buy Reserved\
      \ Instances, the larger the upfront payment, the greater the discount. To maximize\
      \ your savings, you can pay all up-front and receive the largest discount. Partial\
      \ up-front RI's offer lower discounts but give you the option to spend less\
      \ up front. Lastly, you can choose to spend nothing up front and receive a smaller\
      \ discount, but allowing you to free up capital to spend in other projects.\n\
      \n By using reserved capacity, your organization can minimize risks, more predictably\
      \ manage budgets, and comply with policies that require longer-term commitments.\n\

      \ more\n\n  With AWS, you can get volume based discounts and realize important\
      \ savings as your usage increases. For services such as S3 and data transfer\
      \ OUT from EC2, pricing is tiered, meaning the more you use, the less you pay\
      \ per GB. In addition, data transfer IN is always free of charge. As a result,\
      \ as your AWS usage needs increase, you benefit from the economies of scale\
      \ that allow you to increase adoption and keep costs under control.  \n \n\n\
      \ As your organization evolves, AWS also gives you options to acquire services\
      \ that help you address your business needs. For example, AWS\u2019 storage\
      \ services portfolio, offers options to help you lower pricing based on how\
      \ frequently you access data, and the performance you need to retrieve it. To\
      \ optimize your savings, choose the right combinations of storage solutions\

    description: "    Amazon QLDB is a fully managed ledger database that provides\
      \ a transparent, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable transaction log\
      \ \u200Eowned by a central trusted authority. Amazon QLDB can be used to track\
      \ each and every application data change and maintains a complete and verifiable\
      \ history of changes over time.\n\n Ledgers are typically used to record a history\
      \ of economic and financial activity in an organization. Many organizations\
      \ build applications with ledger-like functionality because they want to maintain\
      \ an accurate history of their applications' data, for example, tracking the\
      \ history of credits and debits in banking transactions, verifying the data\
      \ lineage of an insurance claim, or tracing movement of an item in a supply\
      \ chain network. Ledger applications are often implemented using custom audit\
      \ tables or audit trails created in relational databases. However, building\
      \ audit functionality with relational databases is time-consuming and prone\
      \ to human error. It requires custom development, and since relational databases\
      \ are not inherently immutable, any unintended changes to the data are hard\
      \ to track and verify. Alternatively, blockchain frameworks, such as Hyperledger\
      \ Fabric and Ethereum, can also be used as a ledger. However, this adds complexity\
      \ as you need to set-up an entire blockchain network with multiple nodes, manage\
      \ its infrastructure, and require the nodes to validate each transaction before\
      \ it can be added to the ledger.\n\n Amazon QLDB is a new class of database\
      \ that eliminates the need to engage in the complex development effort of building\
      \ your own ledger-like applications. With QLDB, your data\u2019s change history\
      \ is immutable \u2013 it cannot be altered or deleted \u2013 and using cryptography,\
      \ you can easily verify that there have been no unintended modifications to\
      \ your application\u2019s data. QLDB uses an immutable transactional log, known\
      \ as a journal, that tracks each application data change and maintains a complete\
      \ and verifiable history of changes over time. QLDB is easy to use because it\
      \ provides developers with a familiar SQL-like API, a flexible document data\
      \ model, and full support for transactions. QLDB\u2019s streaming capability\
      \ provides a near real-time flow of your data stored within QLDB, allowing you\
      \ to develop event-driven workflows, real-time analytics, and to replicate data\
      \ to other AWS services to support advanced analytical processing. QLDB is also\
      \ serverless, so it automatically scales to support the demands of your application.\
      \ There are no servers to manage and no read or write limits to configure. With\

    description: "    AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your\
      \ web applications or APIs against common web exploits that may affect availability,\
      \ compromise security, or consume excessive resources. AWS WAF gives you control\
      \ over how traffic reaches your applications by enabling you to create security\
      \ rules that block common attack patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site\
      \ scripting, and rules that filter out specific traffic patterns you define.\
      \ You can get started quickly using Managed Rules for AWS WAF, a pre-configured\
      \ set of rules managed by AWS or AWS Marketplace Sellers. The Managed Rules\
      \ for WAF address issues like the OWASP Top 10 security risks. These rules are\
      \ regularly updated as new issues emerge. AWS WAF includes a full-featured API\
      \ that you can use to automate the creation, deployment, and maintenance of\
      \ security rules.\n\n With AWS WAF, you pay only for what you use. The pricing\
      \ is based on how many rules you deploy and how many web requests your application\
      \ receives. There are no upfront commitments.\n\n You can deploy AWS WAF on\
      \ Amazon CloudFront as part of your CDN solution, the Application Load Balancer\
      \ that fronts your web servers or origin servers running on EC2, or Amazon API\
      \ Gateway for your APIs.  \n \n\n     "

    description: "    Amazon WorkLink is a fully managed service that lets you provide\
      \ your employees with secure, easy access to your internal corporate websites\
      \ and web apps using their mobile phones. Traditional solutions such as Virtual\
      \ Private Networks (VPNs) and device management software are inconvenient to\
      \ use on the go, and often require the use of custom browsers that have a poor\
      \ user experience. As a result, employees often forgo using them altogether.\n\
      \n With Amazon WorkLink, employees can access internal web content as easily\
      \ as they access any public website, without the hassle of connecting to their\
      \ corporate network. When a user accesses an internal website, the page is first\
      \ rendered in a browser running in a secure container in AWS. Amazon WorkLink\
      \ then sends the contents of that page to employee phones as vector graphics\
      \ while preserving the functionality and interactivity of the page. This approach\
      \ is more secure than traditional solutions because internal content is never\
      \ stored or cached by the browser on employee phones, and employee devices never\
      \ connect directly to your corporate network.\n\n With Amazon WorkLink, there\
      \ are no minimum fees or long-term commitments. You pay only for users that\
      \ connect to the service each month, and there is no additional charge for bandwidth\

      \ just a few minutes and quickly scale to provide thousands of desktops to workers\
      \ across the globe. You can pay either monthly or hourly, just for the WorkSpaces\
      \ you launch, which helps you save money when compared to traditional desktops\
      \ and on-premises VDI solutions. Amazon WorkSpaces helps you eliminate the complexity\
      \ in managing hardware inventory, OS versions and patches, and Virtual Desktop\
      \ Infrastructure (VDI), which helps simplify your desktop delivery strategy.\
      \ With Amazon WorkSpaces, your users get a fast, responsive desktop of their\
      \ choice that they can access anywhere, anytime, from any supported device.\
      \  \n \n\n         Introduction to Amazon WorkSpaces             Benefits\n\
      =========\n\n   ###  Simplify Desktop Delivery\n\n  Amazon WorkSpaces helps\
      \ you eliminate many administrative tasks associated with managing your desktop\
      \ lifecycle including provisioning, deploying, maintaining, and recycling desktops.\
      \ There is less hardware inventory to manage and no need for complex virtual\
      \ desktop infrastructure (VDI) deployments that don\u2019t scale.   \n \n\n\
      \    ###  Reduce Costs\n\n  Amazon WorkSpaces eliminates the need to over-buy\
      \ desktop and laptop resources by providing on-demand access to cloud desktops\
      \ that include a range of compute, memory, and storage resources to meet your\
      \ users' performance needs.  \n \n\n      ###  Keep Your Data Secure\n\n  Amazon\
      \ WorkSpaces is deployed within an Amazon Virtual Private Network (VPC), provide\
      \ each user with access to persistent, encrypted storage volumes in the AWS\
      \ Cloud, and integrate with AWS Key Management Service (KMS). No user data is\
      \ stored on the local device. This helps improve the security of user data and\
      \ reduces your overall risk surface area.  \n \n\n    ###  Centrally Manage\
      \ and Scale Your Global Desktop Deployment\n\n  Amazon WorkSpaces is available\
      \ in 13 AWS Regions and provides access to high performance cloud desktops wherever\
      \ your teams get work done. You can manage a global deployment of many thousands\
      \ of WorkSpaces from the AWS console. And you can rapidly provision and de-provision\
      \ desktops as the needs of your workforce change.  \n \n\n              Use\
      \ cases\n----------\n\n ###  Provide secure cloud desktops for remote, mobile,\
      \ and contract employees\n\n  The rapid growth of remote and mobile workers\
      \ is placing pressure on IT to provide fast, easy access to corporate applications\
      \ and data from the device of their choice. Amazon WorkSpaces helps mobile and\
      \ remote employees access the applications users need by delivering a cloud\
      \ desktop accessible anywhere with an internet connection using any supported\
      \ device.  \n \n\n  ###  Enable bring your own device\n\n  To deliver on the\
      \ promise of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) initiatives, IT must ensure employees\
      \ can easily and securely access their applications and data across a large\
      \ and constantly changing number of devices. Amazon WorkSpaces lets you run\
      \ a cloud desktop directly on a wide range of devices like PC, Mac, iPad, Kindle\
      \ Fire, Android tablet, Chromebook, and web browsers like Firefox, and Chrome.\
      \ This gives you the tools to deliver a secure, responsive desktop experience\
      \ that will delight your users and help make your BYOD initiative a reality.\
      \  \n \n\n  ###  Rapidly provision and scale desktops for software test and\
      \ development\n\n  Developers and test teams need access to a secure, high-performance\
      \ WorkSpace for completing tasks without the expense and inventory that comes\
      \ with a lot of over-provisioned physical hardware. You can provision Amazon\
      \ WorkSpaces that includes all the tools your developers need to build applications\
      \ quickly. Your source code is not stored on developers\u2019 devices helping\
      \ ensure the safety of your intellectual property.   \n \n\n  ###  Quickly provision\
      \ persistent desktops for classroom and lab settings\n\n  Amazon WorkSpaces\
      \ provides a full, persistent desktop that students can use throughout their\
      \ education while [Amazon AppStream 2.0](https://aws.amazon.com/appstream2/)\
      \ lets course instructors quickly deliver specific applications for the unique\
      \ needs for their class. Used together, you can easily build the learning environment\
      \ your students need and ensure students have what they need for your class\
      \ from day one.  \n \n\n  ###  Rapid integration during mergers and acquisitions\n\
      \n  Companies going through M&A activity must support quickly on-boarding or\
      \ off-loading large numbers of employees with fast, easy, secure access to company\
      \ applications and data. They must do so across a diverse set of devices without\
      \ spending much money or going through lengthy complex integrations. With Amazon\
      \ WorkSpaces, IT teams quickly can provision and decommission secure WorkSpaces\
      \ to keep up with changing organizational structures.  \n \n\n         Customer\

      \ specific permissions for your applications using a shared data set. S3 Replication\
      \ features manage data replication within the region or to other regions. S3\
      \ Batch Operations helps manage large scale changes across billions of objects.\
      \ S3 integration with Amazon Macie automatically provides an inventory of buckets\
      \ and continually evaluates your S3 buckets to alert you to any unencrypted\
      \ buckets, publicly accessible buckets, or buckets shared with AWS accounts.\

      \ across your S3 objects (and other data sets in AWS) with our query-in-place\
      \ services. Use **Amazon Athena** to query S3 data with standard SQL expressions\
      \ and **Amazon Redshift Spectrum** to analyze data that is stored across your\
      \ AWS data warehouses and S3 resources. You can also use **S3 Select** to retrieve\

      \ **S3 Cross-Region Replication**, and other AWS compute, networking, and database\
      \ services, you can create DR architectures in order to quickly and easily recover\
      \ from outages caused by natural disasters, system failures, and human errors.\n\
      \n  [Learn more about DR \xBB](/disaster-recovery/)\n\n    ###  Archive\n\n\
      \  Retire physical infrastructure, and archive data with **S3 Glacier** and\
      \ **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**. These S3 Storage Classes retain objects long-term\
      \ at the lowest rates. Simply create an S3 Lifecycle policy to archive objects\
      \ throughout their lifecycles, or upload objects directly to the archival storage\
      \ classes. With **S3 Object Lock**, you can apply retention dates to objects\
      \ to protect them from deletions, and meet compliance requirements. Unlike tape\
      \ libraries, S3 Glacier lets you restore archived objects in as little as one\
      \ minute for expedited retrievals and 3-5 hours for standard retrievals. Bulk\
      \ data restores from S3 Glacier and all restores from S3 Glacier Deep Archive\
      \ are completed within 12 hours.\n\n [Learn more about archiving \xBB](/glacier/)\n\
      \n      ###  Data lakes and big data analytics\n\n  Accelerate innovation by\
      \ building a [data lake on Amazon S3](/products/storage/data-lake-storage/),\
      \ and extract valuable insights using query-in-place, analytics, and machine\
      \ learning tools. As your data lake grows, use S3 Access Points to easily configure\
      \ access to your data, with specific permissions for each application or sets\
      \ of applications. You can also use **AWS Lake Formation** to quickly create\
      \ a data lake, and centrally define and enforce security, governance, and auditing\
      \ policies. The service collects data across your databases and S3 resources,\
      \ moves it into a new data lake in Amazon S3, and cleans and classifies it using\
      \ machine learning algorithms. All AWS resources can be scaled up to accommodate\
      \ your expanding data stores \u2014 without upfront investments.\n\n Learn more\
      \ about building a [data lake on Amazon S3](/products/storage/data-lake-storage/)\
      \ and [AWS Lake Formation \xBB](/lake-formation/)\n\n    ###  Hybrid cloud storage\n\
      \n  **AWS Storage Gateway** lets you seamlessly connect and extend your on-premises\
      \ applications to AWS Storage all while caching data locally for low-latency\
      \ access. You can also automate data transfers between on-premises storage,\
      \ including from S3 on Outposts, and Amazon S3 by using **AWS DataSync**, which\
      \ can transfer data at speeds up to 10 times faster than open-source tools.\
      \ You can also transfer files directly into and out of Amazon S3 withthe **AWS\
      \ Transfer Family** \u2014 a fully managed, simple, and seamless service that\
      \ enables secure file exchanges with third parties using SFTP, FTPS, and FTP.\
      \ Another way to enable a hybrid cloud storage environment is to work with a\
      \ gateway provider from the APN.\n\n Learn more about [AWS Storage Gateway \xBB\

      \n    ###  Cloud-native applications\n\n  Build fast, cost-effective mobile\
      \ and internet-based applications by using AWS services and Amazon S3 to store\
      \ development and production data shared by the microservices that make up cloud-native\
      \ applications. With Amazon S3, you can upload any amount of data and access\
      \ it anywhere in order to deploy applications faster and reach more end users.\
      \ Storing data in Amazon S3 means you have access to the latest AWS developer\
      \ tools, S3 API, and services for machine learning and analytics to innovate\
      \ and optimize your cloud-native applications.\n\n [Learn more about cloud-native\
